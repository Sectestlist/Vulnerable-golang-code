# Remote File Inclusion (RFI):
Go doesn't support RFI directly like some other languages (like PHP), as it does not have a feature to include and execute remote files within the code. Therefore, an example for RFI in Go cannot be provided.

# Directory Traversal Attack:
The same LFI example can be used for Directory Traversal as well. If the user provides a filename like ../../etc/passwd, it could potentially read sensitive files from the system.

Always remember, these examples represent very insecure programming practices. In a secure application, you should always validate and sanitize user inputs. Never trust user input implicitly. Use secure coding techniques to protect your application and its users.
